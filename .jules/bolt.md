## 2026-10-13 - Prioritize LCP images
**Learning:** Explicitly marking above-the-fold images with fetchpriority="high" and loading="eager" improves LCP performance, especially for dynamically generated elements where the browser might defer loading.
**Action:** Always add fetchpriority="high" and loading="eager" attributes to the main visible image when optimizing above-the-fold content.
## 2026-10-14 - Replace Large CDNs with Targeted Local CSS\n**Learning:** Large external CSS libraries (like hover.css) often contain many rules that are completely unused by the application. Loading them via CDN blocks rendering and downloads unnecessary bytes.\n**Action:** For small utility libraries, extract only the specifically used CSS classes and include them directly in the project's local stylesheet bundle.
## 2026-10-14 - Move global JS to route-specific JS
**Learning:** Loading route-specific scripts (like pgp.js) in a global layout causes unnecessary JS execution and larger payloads on unrelated pages.
**Action:** Conditionally load JS scripts only on the pages or layouts that actually require them.
